# Web Scraping News Headlines

This program scrapes the top seven headlines from three news sources: The Wall Street Journal, The Verge, and Business of Fashion. The program will prompt the user how many headlines they wish to view and the result will be outputted on the terminal.

## Motivation

The desire to build this program is to practice web scraping and find a use case to apply it to my everyday life.

## Getting Started

This program is in Ruby and requires Open URI and Nokogiri to open and parse the live sites. You will need to install both gems to run the program:

```
gem install nokogiri
gem install open-uri
```

Pry is not needed for the program, but was used to test the program during development.

This is relatively simple to run as there is no front-end interface, and the result is outputted on the terminal.
